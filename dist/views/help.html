<div class="row marketing" style="margin-top: 10px"><h3>Confused? This page will help!</h3><h4>Where do I start?</h4><p>To start, use the <a href="#/todo-list">Todo List</a> to create a list of your tasks. The form at the top of the page will assist you in adding new tasks. These tasks will be saved in your browser, so you don't have to worry about losing them when you're done browsing. Be sure to describe the task, give it a priority, and set its due date!</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>Once you've added a task, you can view it in the Todo List section of the page. A color-coded priority badge, along with the due date, will be visible. If you wish to edit or delete the task, you can do so by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> icon.</p><p>Multiple sorting options are available: Alphabetical (by description), by Priority, and by Due Date. Try them all and use whichever is most convenient for you at a given moment!</p><p>Complete a task by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> on the left side of the todo. Once a task is completed, it moves to the Done Todos section of the page. You can expand your Done Todos by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></i>, and collapse it again by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></i>. To move a Done Todo back up to your Todo List, click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up"></i>, located in the same spot as the checkmark. If you wish to completely delete a task, click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></i> icon on a Done Todo (Warning: Your browser will not remember a task if you choose to delete it!). Sorting options are also available for Done Todos.</p><h4>Is that it?</h4><p><em>Prioritize</em> isn't meant to be complicated!
