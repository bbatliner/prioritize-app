<div class="row marketing" style="margin-top: 10px"><h3>Confused? This page will help!</h3><h4>Where do I start?</h4><p>To start, use the <a href="#/todo-list">Todo List</a> to create a list of your tasks. Add new projects by using the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></i> on the project tabs. Once you've created a project, you can add tasks to it using the form on that tab.</p><h4>What's next?</h4><p>Once you've created a task, you can view it in the Todo List section of the page. A color-coded priority badge, along with the due date, will be visible. If you wish to edit the task, you can do so by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-pencil"></i> icon.</p><h4>What are these "projects"?</h4><p>Projects are an easy way for you to keep track of the many "categories" of tasks you have in your life. If you're a student, try creating a project for each of your classes. If you're a manager, try creating one for each of your real-life projects.</p><p>By clicking on the project tabs at the top of the Todo List page, you can filter your todos by project. For example, clicking on the "School" project, if it exists, will only show you your School todos. Clicking on the "All" tab will show all todos from every project, and label the project on the todo.</p><h4>How do I edit/finish/interact with my todos?</h4><p>Complete a task by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></i> on the left side of the todo. Once a task is completed, it moves to the Done Todos section of the page. You can expand your Done Todos by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down"></i>, and collapse it again by clicking the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-up"></i>. To move a Done Todo back up to your Todo List, click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-arrow-up"></i>, located in the same spot as the checkmark. If you wish to completely delete a task, click the <i class="glyphicon glyphicon-trash"></i> icon on a Done Todo (Warning: Your browser will not remember a task if you choose to delete it!). Sorting options are also available for Done Todos.</p><h4>Is that it?</h4><p><em>Prioritize</em> isn't meant to be complicated!
